        <p>Are You Retro or Nouveau? Classic or Creative? Let’s infuse some fresh thinking into our sandwich-making routine, with an Old School vs. New School faceoff. Maybe you’d like one of these updated takes on lunch—or maybe you’d like to try an old favorite for the first time in years. Let the battles begin.</p>
        <p>
        When you can find a tell-your-momma-about-it dish at a gas station and it tastes just as good as a white tablecloth bistro, well, that’s comforting. Luckily, families from Alamogordo to Albuquerque all seem to know how to make this spicy wake-up call: strips of crispy traditional bacon wrapped in local goodness: shredded potatoes, scrambled eggs and cheddar cheese, and a secret-weapon sauce of minced garlic, chopped onions and Hatch green chiles. We are sworn to secrecy about that gas station, but please, try this at home.</p>
